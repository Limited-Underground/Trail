# OpenTrail Project Status

As of 2026-09-08. This page summarizes accepted behavior and the next work; dated
history belongs in [PROGRESS_LOG.md](PROGRESS_LOG.md). The complete prior status,
including assumptions and older decision checkpoints, is preserved in the
[2026-09-08 archive](history/PROJECT_STATUS_BEFORE_CLEANUP_2026-09-08.md).
See [archive navigation](history/README.md) for moved headings, [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
for design and the [backlog](../tasks/BACKLOG.md) for every task identifier.

## Current accepted capabilities

- Two Heltec/Android pairs have protected BLE authorization, Snapshot/Ready,
  saved-owner reconnect, name and region readbacks, and automatic clock sync
  evidence. These are bench-development results, not field or release acceptance.
- The second Heltec/S24 pair has accepted fresh pairing, a recognizable setup label
  retained after timeout, an editable first-use name suggestion, durable Trail
  Bench 2 name and US915 restoration, and warm/app-only recovery. US915 selection
  does not enable radio transmission.
- The latest S24-only app update preserves data/base app and passed exact installed
  readback. It prioritizes authorization controls, removes a misleading mode switch,
  and persists fresh-setup navigation after exact reset verification. Pending reset
  verification wins; authenticated Ready clears the marker. It does not delete
  Android bonds or reconstruct resets performed by an older app.
- The host-only benchmark successor composes buffered receipts, startup checks,
  fresh-handle restart and separate per-role recovery images. Byte-level tests
  also correct receipt type identity and the firmware's SHA-256 field parsing.
  This does not prove the old OT-163 hardware root cause or product messaging.

## Last verified bench configuration

| Pair | Firmware | Android app | Evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Original Heltec / Note20 | `ot178-phone-v1`, 586,736 bytes, SHA prefix `43AC6DBC` | V1-Test SHA prefix `CCC4F1EB` | Retained paired control; still needs the newer clock correction. |
| Second Heltec / S24 Ultra | `ot171-label-v1`, 587,968 bytes, SHA prefix `984E241D` | V1-Test 12,505,942 bytes, SHA prefix `5FD10EF0` | Trail Bench 2 / US915; latest app-only Ready observed in 31.015 seconds with protected name/region readback and clock-sync acknowledgement. |

These are recorded observations, not a fresh live-device inventory. Full hashes,
setup, and results are in [pairing-flow evidence](testing/OT-171-PAIRING-FLOW-2026-09-08.md)
and [setup continuation](testing/OT-171-SETUP-CONTINUATION-2026-09-07.md).
The latest Android matrix passed 1,104 tests with no failures/errors/skips, all
variant lint/build tasks and unsigned-release audit. The release APK remains
unsigned. Physical fresh post-reset behavior of the latest navigation marker and
normal/large-font candidate visibility remain untested by that update.

## Next meaningful capability

Prepare one complete executable benchmark successor with the concrete role-checking
backend and exact source/image bindings. Verify current endpoints, installed bytes,
partitions and both recovery images before a fresh non-reusable execution grant.
The old shared restore image and consumed authority cannot be reused. See
[host composition evidence](testing/OT-163-SUCCESSOR-COMPOSITION-2026-09-08.md).

After the remaining crypto measurement/admission and explicit suite/wire selection,
implement one authenticated two-node message exchange, then its protected BLE
phone send/receive path. Current firmware reports radio unavailable, and the real
Messages screen prepares local templates only. Existing BLE success is not
Phone A to Phone B delivery. [Decision 0003](decisions/0003-crypto-benchmark-gate.md)
and [secure-LoRa contract](security/SECURE_LORA_KEY_TRANSPORT_V0.md) retain the
selection and security gates.

## Remaining acceptance and decisions

Post-release concepts remain separately scoped in the
[future-concepts register](FUTURE_CONCEPTS.md).
[Decision 0036](decisions/0036-post-v2-public-lane-and-assistance-direction.md)
records the post-V2 public-lane and assistance direction; it adds no current
release commitment or completion credit.

- Real protected message commands/events, peer/key provisioning, secure packet
  framing, persistent counters/replay protection, LoRa TX/RX and delivery ACKs.
- Complete reset-domain cleanup, cross-pair denial/isolation, physical rotation
  and large-font flows, automatic production launch and release packaging/signing.
- Target-specific radio/regulatory, antenna, power/battery and GNSS evidence;
  calibrated battery behavior, sustained clock accuracy and field measurements.
- Protected storage/rollback and selected cryptography remain distinct from the
  already working local BLE ownership/name/region storage.
- Multi-region radio operation is not accepted merely because all twelve region
  choices are represented in settings. Emergency features remain safety aids,
  not guaranteed rescue. Map licensing/offline-provider and later platform work
  retain their architectural gates.

The [canonical V1 record](V1_PROGRESS.json) remains unchanged at exact 45.50%
(displayed 46%). No score was earned by this documentation cleanup. Website bulk
updates, numeric-keypad work and cold-power disassembly remain owner-deferred.
