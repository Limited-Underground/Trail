# Cryptographic Benchmark Evidence v0

Status: host-tested evidence boundary; target plan blocked, 2026-08-10

## Purpose

`OTCB0/v0` turns the cryptographic selection gate into reproducible,
machine-checked evidence. It does not benchmark cryptography on the host, select
a library, implement Noise, or make packet v0 secure. It ensures that a future
ESP32-S3 comparison cannot omit the exact target, dependency locks, repetitions,
resource costs, radio costs, or failure gates and still be reported as passing.

The tool is `tools/crypto_benchmark.py`. The public starting plan is
`tests/benchmarks/crypto/OT-005-CRYPTO-BENCHMARK-PLAN-V0.json`.

## Plan contract

A plan has one of two states:

- `draft_blocked`: structurally valid, names at least one blocker, and may leave
  the exact target/lock fields empty; or
- `ready`: no blockers and every board, toolchain, dependency, sdkconfig, and
  radio field is exact.

The ordered candidate set is deliberately fixed to the dated review:

1. Espressif libsodium as the primary target benchmark;
2. the pinned ESP-IDF mbedTLS/PSA build as a comparison; and
3. Monocypher as a small-footprint comparison.

Each candidate needs an exact version, 40-character source commit, dependency-
lock SHA-256, and SPDX license expression before the plan can become `ready`.
The plan also fixes exactly 100 cold and 100 warm repetitions and the complete
eight-gate acceptance set. A canonical, formatting-independent JSON SHA-256
binds results to the reviewed plan.

The current public plan is honestly `draft_blocked` because the exact client
board/revision, ESP-IDF/toolchain/sdkconfig, candidate commits/locks, and direct-
radio MTU/PHY profile have not been frozen. The validator will not generate a
result template from it.

## Result contract

One result evaluates one candidate under one exact ready plan. It records:

- the benchmark ID, canonical plan SHA-256, candidate, and completion time;
- cold/warm repetition counts;
- min/median/p95/max microseconds for Ed25519 sign/verify, X25519, SHA-256,
  HKDF-SHA256, IETF ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypt/decrypt, and the XK handshake;
- build success and warning count;
- linked-flash delta, static and peak-dynamic RAM, maximum stack used, and
  watchdog resets;
- handshake bytes, fragments, measured airtime, and retry coverage;
- binary, sdkconfig, and SBOM SHA-256 values plus private raw-evidence
  retention; and
- every vector/interoperability/entropy/wipe/counter/lifecycle/license gate.

Timing statistics must be positive and nondecreasing. The result sdkconfig must
match the plan. Unknown/missing fields, noncanonical operations, plan-hash
mismatch, and private machine/device text are invalid rather than measured
failures.

For a structurally valid result, the deterministic verdict is `fail` if the
plan is not ready, either repetition count is below 100, the build fails, any
compiler warning or watchdog reset occurs, raw evidence was not retained, or
any required gate is false. Only a complete result without those failures is
`pass`.

A candidate-level `pass` is benchmark evidence, not automatic production
selection. Library selection still requires review of all candidates, target
behavior, recovery constraints, and the decision gate.

## Public-evidence boundary

The artifact has no fields for serial number, MAC address, transport port,
pairing PIN, password, private key, secret value, or local path. The validator
also rejects Windows/user paths, COM-port text, MAC-like values, and obvious
credential assignments found inside free text. Raw traces stay private; public
artifacts contain only aggregate measurements and hashes.

Result-template creation requires a ready plan and uses exclusive file creation,
so it refuses overwrite. The generated template has blank hashes/timestamp,
zero measurements/repetitions, `build.passed=false`, and every gate false; it is
intentionally invalid/incomplete and cannot be mistaken for a passing result.

## Host evidence and remaining gates

Eight deterministic scenario groups cover the blocked public plan, exact ready-
plan structure, candidate/gate set enforcement, plan-bound template creation and
overwrite refusal, a complete pass, measured failures, plan/config mismatch,
private-text rejection, and incomplete/noncanonical measurements.

This is only an evidence-quality gate. No library has been imported or selected,
no ESP32-S3 target benchmark has run, and entropy, interoperability, resource,
radio, physical join/revoke/reset, protected storage, and power-interruption
evidence remain open.
